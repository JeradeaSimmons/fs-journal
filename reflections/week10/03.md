## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Rows are records and columns are fields

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
DELETE would remove the whole table, drop only removes contents of table.

## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

Declaration- function name(param){
} hoisted so they can be used before defined
Expressions- let name = function(param){
} not hoisted so they have to be defined before use
Arrow- let name = (param) => {
} these do not create their own this value

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters are a part of the function. Arguments equal a value.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Higher functions perform operations on other functions.

## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using and API that has multiple streaming service sources. Hoping to be able to utilize that to help user match partners movies/shows depending on what they actually have availability to.

2. What went well so far?

Team work. Very solid communication and our vision for the app feels to be on the same page.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

Our API hasn't worked out quite like we wanted so maybe a different API.

## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have really enjoyed this course. Definitely feel each week of being lost and then things starting to click and then showing myself I am capable once I passed the Checkpoints.

I want to hopefully have my backend for the final done by Monday so that I can hopefully then get my Front end done by Wednesday. This way I have a two day period just in case I need to do a little more. I don't want to push and stress all the way to Friday.

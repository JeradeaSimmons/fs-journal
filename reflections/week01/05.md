# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

I know it will get harder as we go, but this first week has added to my excitement of this career path.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? 

I think the week as a whole went very well.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

How much I've retained through lecture and practice.

- What are you struggling with?

Flex everything. Need to keep practicing with it.

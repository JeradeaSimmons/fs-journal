## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
   Specificity is how CSS chooses which rule to follow if you have written in multiple rules targeting the same element and property. The benifits are you can 
   create a more broad rule to use on your project but then have more targeted rules that will be followed due to having higher specificity.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
   Would be a waste of time. It would override so much of the code you wrote.
